# Valid values are "no" and "yes"

# The default sleep/wake system to use.  Valid values are:
#   kernel    The built-in kernel suspend/resume support.
#             Use this if nothing else is supported on your system.
#   uswsusp   If your system has support for the userspace
#             suspend programs (s2ram/s2disk/s2both), then use this.
#   tuxonice  If your system has support for tuxonice, use this.

# The system defaults to "kernel" if this is commented out.
